# Random Ron

When the page loads, a random quote from the Ron Swanson Quotes API should be displayed in the blockquote element.

When the More Ron button is clicked, a new quote from the API should replace the current one.

If the same quote gets returned from the API in the last 50 quotes, it is skipped and another one is fetched instead.
